Perfect, you have upgraded your Controller level!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> If you donâ€™t upgrade your Controller within 20,000 game ticks, it loses one level.
On reaching level 0, you will lose control over the room, and another player will be able to capture it freely.
Make sure that at least one of your creeps regularly performs the function <code>upgradeController</code>.
