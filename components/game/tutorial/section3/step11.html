<p>
In total, we have 550 energy units in our spawn and extensions. It is enough to build a creep with the body
<code>[WORK,WORK,WORK,WORK,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE]</code>. This creep will work 4 times faster than a regular worker
creep. Its body is heavier, so weâ€™ll add another <code>MOVE</code> to it. However, two parts are still not
enough to move it at the speed of a small fast creep which would require 4x<code>MOVEs</code> or building a road.
