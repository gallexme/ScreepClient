You will have to create new creeps when old ones die from age or some other reasons. Since there are no
events in the game to report death of a particular creep, the easiest way is to just count the number of
required creeps, and if it becomes less than a defined value, to start spawning.
</p>
<p>
There are several ways to count the number of creeps of the required type. One of them is filtering
<code>Game.creeps</code> with the help of the <code>_.filter</code> function and using the role in
their memory. Letâ€™s try to do that and bring the number of creeps into the console.

<div class='objective'>
<div class='fa fa-caret-right'></div>
Add the output of the number of creeps with the role <code>harvester</code> into the console.

<div class='objective'>
<div class='fa fa-caret-down'></div>
