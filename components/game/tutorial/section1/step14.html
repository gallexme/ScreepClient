Here you can write scripts that will run on a permanent basis, each game tick in a loop.
It allows writing constantly working programs to control behaviour of your creeps which will work even while you
are offline (in the real game only, not the Simulation Room mode).
</p>
<p>
To commit a script to the game so it can run, use this button or <strong>Ctrl+Enter</strong>.

<p>
The code for each Tutorial section is created in its own branch. You can view code from these branches for
further use in your scripts.
